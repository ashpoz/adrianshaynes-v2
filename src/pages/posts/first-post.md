All frontmatter properties are available as props to an Astro layout component.

The `layout` property is the only special one provided by Astro.

You can use it in Markdown files located within `src/pages/posts`.

```javascript
// here's a code snippet
function coolFunction(length) {
	for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
		console.log(i)
	}
}

coolFunction(10)
```
